# Image2Story

Image2Story is an application that translates images to text using a model from Hugging Face and then generates a story based on the extracted text using the OpenAI API. The images uploaded by users are stored in Firebase, and the app is built with React, Langchain.js for llm interaction, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The project aims to provide users with a creative and interactive way to transform images into narrative stories.

## Technologies Used

- [Langchain.js](https://github.com/langchain/langchain) for language processing
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
